# Networking Learning – NetPractice (Updated Version)

This repository documents my learning journey through the **updated NetPractice project**.  
It focuses on understanding networking concepts rather than only solving the exercises.
This activity has been created as part of the 42 curriculum by mowaidat.

Unlike older versions of the project, this repository emphasizes:

- conceptual understanding
- visual explanations
- subnetting logic
- routing decisions
- packet flow across networks

The goal is to make the project useful not only for evaluation, but also as a **reference for learning networking fundamentals**.

# 📘 What This Repository Contains

This repo is structured to separate:

- 🔹 visual diagrams for each level
- 🔹 written explanations for every scenario
- 🔹 core networking fundamentals
- 🔹 routing and packet behavior explanations

It is meant to be read progressively, from fundamentals to complex routing scenarios.

# 🧠 How to Use This Repository

If you are new to networking, follow this order:

### 1️⃣ Start with fundamentals
- subnetting basics
- routing logic
- packet flow behavior

📍 Go to:  
`fundamentals/`

---

### 2️⃣ Then explore the levels
Each level contains:

- diagram
- explanation
- networking concept behind it

📍 Go to:  
`levels/`

---

### 3️⃣ Diagrams only
If you just want the visual network layouts:

📍 Go to:  
`diagrams/`

# 🎯 Learning Goals of This Project

Through this project I focused on:

- understanding subnet masks and block sizes
- calculating host ranges quickly
- understanding default gateway behavior
- learning how routers actually choose routes
- understanding longest prefix match
- seeing how packets move hop-by-hop
- understanding real-world routing logic

This repository is meant to reflect the **thinking process**, not only the final answers.
